    "This notebook serves as an introductory guide to Python, covering fundamental syntax, data handling, and basic operations. Based on the cells provided, here is a comprehensive breakdown of the topics covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Python Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print()` function is the primary way to display data to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Case Sensitivity:** Python is case-sensitive (e.g., `print` works, but `Print` will cause an error).\n",
    "* **Data Output:** You can print strings, integers, floats, and booleans.\n",
    "* **Multiple Arguments:** The `print()` function can take multiple values separated by commas, which are printed with a space between them by default.\n",
    "* **Parameters:**\n",
    "* `sep`: Customizes the separator between multiple items (e.g., `sep='/'`).\n",
    "* `end`: Customizes what is printed at the end of the line. By default, it is a newline (`\\n`), but it can be changed to a character like `-` to keep the next print on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types used to categorize different kinds of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Basic Types:** Integer (`int`), Float (`float`), Boolean (`bool`), Complex (`5+6j`), and String (`str`).\n",
    "* **Sequence/Collection Types:** * **List:** Ordered, mutable collection (e.g., `[1,2,3]`).\n",
    "* **Tuple:** Ordered, immutable collection (e.g., `(1,2,3)`).\n",
    "* **Set:** Unordered collection of unique items (e.g., `{1,2,3}`).\n",
    "* **Dictionary:** Collection of Key-Value pairs (e.g., `{'name':'Nitish'}`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type Checking:** Use the `type()` function to identify the data type of a value or variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables act as containers for storing data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dynamic Typing:** In Python, you don’t need to declare the type of a variable; it is determined at runtime based on the value assigned.\n",
    "* **Dynamic Binding:** A variable's type can change over time if it is reassigned to a different type of data (e.g., `a = 5` then `a = 'nitish'`).\n",
    "* **Declaration Styles:**\n",
    "* **Single:** `a = 1`\n",
    "* **Multiple:** `a, b, c = 1, 2, 3`.\n",
    "* **Uniform:** `a = b = c = 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single-line:** Use the `#` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Keywords & Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Keywords:** Reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "* **Identifiers:** Names given to entities like variables or functions.\n",
    "* Rules: Cannot start with a digit; can include letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`); cannot be a keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. User Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The `input()` function allows the program to accept data from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Default Type:** `input()` always returns data as a **string**.\n",
    "* **Type Casting:** To use numerical input, you must wrap the input in a type function, such as `int(input())` or `float(input())`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Type Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Implicit Conversion:** Python automatically converts one data type to another (e.g., adding an `int` to a `float` results in a `float`).\n",
    "* **Explicit Conversion:** Manually converting types using functions like `int()`, `float()`, or `str()`.\n",
    "* **Errors:** Adding incompatible types (like an `int` and a `str`) will result in a `TypeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "Literals represent the raw data assigned to variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numeric:** Supports Binary (`0b`), Octal (`0o`), and Hexadecimal (`0x`).\n",
    "* **Float:** Supports scientific notation (e.g., `1.5e2` for ).\n",
    "* **String Literals:** Supports single, double, and triple quotes (for multiline strings), as well as Raw strings (`r\"\"`) and Unicode strings.\n",
    "* **Boolean/Special:** `True`, `False`, and `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Operators & Control Flow (Intro)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook briefly introduces categories for **Operators** (Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise, Assignment, and Membership) and the syntax for **If-Else** conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to create some practice exercises based on these Python fundamentals?"
