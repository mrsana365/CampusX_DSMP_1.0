1) > procedure oriented Programming 

All the programs we have created so far are around function, that is block
of statements which is block of statements which manipulateds data .

This is called procedure oriented way of programming 

In this way we always list down the tasks , and second thing what is procedure to do that tasks
In this data is not main thing procedure is main things

"""

# def inputBook ():
#     bookId = int ( input ("Enter your BookId :"))
#     tittle = input ("Enter your BookId :")
#     price = float ( input ("Enter your BookId :"))

#     myBook = ( bookId , tittle , price)
#     return myBook

# def main ():
#     bookId = 1
#     tittle = "Python made easy "
#     price = 400.0

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
2) > Object Oriented Programming 

There is another way of organizing your program , which is to combined data and functionality and wrap it inside 
something called 

This is called Object Oriented way of programming .

This approach is more suitable to large programes.


"""

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
1) > Encapsulation class and Object
2) > Inheritance
3) > Polymorphism
4) > Data hiding( not mostlt in python)
5) > Abstraction (not mostlt in python)


Encapsulation -->> An act of combining properties and method related to the same entity is called encapsulation.



"""

# ------   BOOK PROPERTY  -------------------
# bookId 
# tittle 
# price 
# bookAuther 

# ------   BOOK METHOD  -------------------

# bookId = int ( input ("Enter your BookId :"))
# tittle = input ("Enter your BookId :")
# price = float ( input ("Enter your BookId :"))


# ---------   Class --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
class having 
        -->> varibles
        -->> function


in class 
    -->> properties
    -->> method 
properties -->>  are called attributes 
method     -->>  are called attributes 

Eg. in list "append" is a attributes of list class

-> Class is a keyword
-> Class is named 
-> Class encapsulates data and functions
-> Creating class is creating  a "NEW" data type
-> class is a description of an object
-> class is blueprint of an object 
->

Examples -->> int , float, complex, bool, list, range, tuple, set, dict, str etc are classes

eg num  = 25 
in this case we created a int class  objecct



"""


# ---------   Object  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
-> Object is an instance ( example ) of a class
-> Object is a real world entity
-> Instances => object => instance object
-> You can create any number of object of a class

"""
x = 5
y = 6
z = 7
# z , y ,z refers to three different object of int class
